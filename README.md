Reed-Solomon Error Correction CODEC in OCaml.

The code is written at a very high level and uses concepts such 
as polynomials in the implementation.

Work is underway to produce a faster implementation based on this
code but is currently incomplete.

See the [iocaml](https://github.com/andrewray/iocaml) notebook
for more information on the library.
